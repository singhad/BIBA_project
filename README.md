# Business Intelligence and Business Analytics Project
(The repository for the Business Intelligence &amp; Business Analytics continuous assessment group project.)

At the time of writing of this report, the world is struggling with a pandemic that is affecting every single human being on this planet. There is an acute shortage of life-saving equipment because all the factories and workplaces responsible for manufacturing them are closed indefinitely. Healthcare workers are on the front-lines, but without these equipment they will die. Strangely, but thankfully, innovative people from various walks of life who own a 3D printer -- a system that uses heat to liquefy thin PVA plastic tubing and construct various 3D objects based on the blueprints supplied to it via a computer -- have come forward to _print_ these essential equipment. <br>

This ingenious idea to _print_ whatever is needed in one's own home inspired the authors of this report to dig deeper and investigate the extent, popularity, feasibility and costs associated with this niche industry. Broadly based on real-life organisations that manufacture and sell 3D printing systems, a fictitious company was created -- _H.V.V.A. 3D Printing Solution_. Mock customer, sales, and purchase data was generated and then fed into a cloud service that piped the datasets into a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software. The whole chain of the Sales section of the company was emulated, and the resulting statistics were visualised. The benefits and conclusions from these visualisations were studied and reported. <br>


### Data Creation:
Mockaroo was used to generate data that was then processed through the data cleaning, transformation and visualisation pipeline.
